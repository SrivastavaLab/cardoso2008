## Survey of macroinvertebrates found in Bromeliads
Study location: Ilha do Cardoso, São Paulo, Brasil, (25° 03' S, 47° 53' W)

### Data format

The data is in the [data directory](data/), stored as rectangular CSV files. There are four files with data, and a fifth containing the metadata:

* **`abundance.csv`**: Abundances of species in bromeliads. Data is in a "long" format, with one row for every bromeliad x species combination.  
* **`environmental_variables.csv`**: Environmental variables measured on each bromeliad. One row per bromeliad species.  
* **`macroinvertebrate_names_mass.csv`**: Traits and notes at the level of each morphospecies. One row for every distinct morphospecies found.  
* **`predator_names.csv`**: A list of all taxa known to be predators. This also maps morphospecies to higher taxonomic levels, where that is necessary.
* **`metadata_dictionary.csv`**: describes the variables in each dataset in detail
### Methods

In 2008, each bromeliad was dissected and washed to remove invertebrates. We passed this water through two sieves (150 and 850 µm), which removed
particulate organic matter without losing any invertebrates. All invertebrates
were counted and identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. The body
length of all individuals was measured when possible for small and medium-sized
taxa (< 1cm final instar) and always for large-bodied taxa (> 1 cm final
instar).
